***Cricket Performance Analytics***

This project aims to analyze and rank cricket players based on their performance metrics. The analysis covers batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicketkeepers using various statistical measures and form factors.





**Features**

•Player performance evaluation based on batting and bowling statistics.

•Calculation of recency, consistency, and form factors for players.

•Ranking of players in different categories: batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicketkeepers.

•Generation of radar plots to visualize player performance metrics.






**Code Structure**


•Step 1: Import necessary libraries and dataframes
Import required libraries and read data into pandas dataframes.

•Step 2: Initialize data structures for batsman and bowler details
Initialize dictionaries to store player details and performance metrics.

•Step 3: Update batsman details
Iterate through the batting dataframe to update player performance metrics.

•Step 4: Update bowler details
Iterate through the bowling dataframe to update player performance metrics.

•Step 5: Calculate form factors
Define a function to calculate form factors for players.

•Step 6: Calculate rankings
Define a function to rank players based on their performance metrics.

•Step 7: Evaluate batsman performance
Define a function to evaluate and update batsman performance metrics.

•Step 8: Evaluate bowler performance
Define a function to evaluate and update bowler performance metrics.

•Step 9: Apply eligibility criteria
Apply criteria to select eligible batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicketkeepers.

•Step 10: Determine maximum metrics
Calculate maximum metrics for normalization.

•Step 11: Rank players
Rank players based on their normalized performance metrics.

•Step 12: Plot radar plots
Generate radar plots to visualize player performance.

•Step 13: Print top players
Print the top 10 players in each category.
